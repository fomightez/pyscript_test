<!-- dcoument based on:
- things worked out in https://fomightez.github.io/pyscript_test/pandastest.html and then simplifying display without using Panel &
instead using Pandas df styler method ===> THIS STOPPED WORKING, NOTICED IN EARLY 2023, had to update based on https://github.com/pyscript/pyscript/blob/main/examples/pandas.html
- had to add jinja2 to what gets installed to get Pandas styler method to work again if not using panel/bokeh, it seems. However it doesn't
need importing

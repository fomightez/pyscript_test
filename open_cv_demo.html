        <h1>Hello World!</h1>
        <p> This is based on 'Panndas Example with reading from relative url in the same location where HTML resides' https://github.com/fomightez/pyscript_test/blob/main/csv_read_from_same_location.html</p>
        <p>And then trying out what worked from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74533570/pyscript-modulenotfounderror-no-module-named-cv2#comment131573724_74533570 where I used Pyodide in JupyterLite to use OpenCV. code at https://gist.github.com/fomightez/2277f4f55cfdb02ea6a7a5d3ca0e335f and niciew view at https://nbviewer.org/gist/fomightez/2277f4f55cfdb02ea6a7a5d3ca0e335f</p>
        <p>This is a test To see how my html code is.</p>
        <p>This space below will become blank as a few seconds is taken to render the ????????. Be patient ...</p>
        <div id="pane"></div>

        <py-script>      
import cv2
#import jinja2

from pyodide.http import open_url

url = 'clown.png'
# example code from https://learning.rc.virginia.edu/notes/opencv/
image = cv2.imread('clown.png')
(h, w, d) = image.shape
print('width={}, height={}, depth={}'.format(w, h, d))

roi = image[30:130,140:240]
plt.imshow(cv2.cvtColor(roi,cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB))
plt.show()



        </py-script>
<!-- dcoument based on:
- `csv_read_test.html` and changing that to a relative URL to read in the same location as where HTML file is found;
also works with `url = './clown.png'`

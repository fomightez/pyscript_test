## trying pyscript stuff


**see [here](https://fomightez.github.io/pyscript_test/test_md_render.html) to see proof using [Eduoardo Bonet's approach](https://twitter.com/EduardoBonet/status/1521841937233465345) at least for now it renders markdown from notebooks just fine** (I had to remove the pyscript stuff because something was causing it to error out and not show markdown.)

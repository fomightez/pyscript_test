## trying pyscript stuff

### What doesn't work here

- Full example of Eduardo Bonet

  [Eduoardo Bonet's approach](https://twitter.com/EduardoBonet/status/1521841937233465345) at least for now doesn't seem to work on GitHub for me. It's showing in the 'Inspect' console that it is out of memory, specifically gives "WebAssembly module validated with warning: failed to allocate executable memory for module". **It works from his site though!!** Go see it at https://eduardobonet.gitlab.io/nblite

### What does work here

#### Markdown cells from notebook do work.

- Example with only markdown cells in a notebook based on the example of Eduardo Bonet

  **see [here](https://fomightez.github.io/pyscript_test/test_md_render.html) to see proof using [Eduoardo Bonet's approach](https://twitter.com/EduardoBonet/status/1521841937233465345) at least for now it renders markdown from notebooks just fine** (I had to remove the pyscript stuff because something was causing it to error out and not show markdown.)
